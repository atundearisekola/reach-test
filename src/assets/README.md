The Task
=============
A single page application that makes two REST api calls to retrieve two data files, and then display the associated data in an appropriate way.

**First call**<br />
https://mockapi.lumi.systems/getdevices <br />
Using userId = "100", and orgId = "Lumi"<br />
Retrieve an array of deviceIds <br />

**Second call**<br />
https://mockapi.lumi.systems/getdevicedata <br />
Using deviceId = "LabEye-dVr"<br />
Retrieve the device resources files <br />

**Retrieved Data**<br />
There will be two files to retrieve and display, A Video file and a corresponding JSON data file. <br />
The JSON file contains a <br />
- Bounding box of the sample area labelled "RoI"<br />
- Frame Array which matches each frame in the video file. 
- Frame data is contains the average Red, Green, Blue pixel values and a histogram difference value.<br />

**Displaying Data**<br />
The video file must be displayed in a video player that allows the user to stop and start the video, and must display a frame track bar. <br />
The corresponding frame data must be displayed on the page for each frame of the video. 

Below is only an example of the possible way to display the data and is not a requirement.<br />

FAQ

  How long is a piece of string? It is totally up to you how much you complete, but the reviewing team will look at quality and quantity when ranking submissions.

**-How Many Times Can I submit?**<br />
  Once, please just update your GitHub repo, depending on when the submission is reviewed the updated repo might not be seen.

**-Can I use other technologies other than those listed in the Requirements**<br />
  Yes as additional technologies, but due to the nature of the available roles we would like to see the use of JavaScript, TypeScript and React.
